Complete data about Nintendo Classics, both in CSV
and a [followable RSS feed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethmlarson/nintendo-classics/refs/heads/main/nintendo-classics.xml).
I [published a full blog post about this dataset](https://sethmlarson.dev/nintendo-classics)
with some interesting tables, graphs, and queries.
